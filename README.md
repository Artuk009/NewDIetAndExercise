# Diet and Exercise Data Analysis
### Introduction

In this project I use Pandas and Visualization libraries 
to explore and analyze personal diet and exercise data that I
have collected, and make adjustments accordingly based on my
findings. This is the planning phase of a grander project where
I plan to create web and mobile applications based on the logic 
from these notebooks. I am perfecting the database structure 
before I begin the development of the applications.

### Diet Analysis

This notebook contains the code for the diet analysis. It is the latest
working version of the diet analysis code. The current features include
a MySQL database connection with a normalized database structure, the ability
to update entries within the database, and relevant calculations and 
visualizations for analysis. 
* Tools: PyMySQL, Pandas, Seaborn, and SQLAlchemy.

### Other Notebooks
* Once I establish a good foundation for the diet analysis, I will begin
adapting the other notebooks to the new database structure.
